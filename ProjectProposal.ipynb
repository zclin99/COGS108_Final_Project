    "Housing is one of the most important lifetime investments one can make. While it can be a long-term equity with a fair market value, it can also have some short-term benefits in terms of paying yourself instead of a landlord. We believe that San Diego is a fine place because it is known for its warm weather climate, ideal location to the ocean, devloping education and job opportunities, and the ease of transportation. However, we are not sure whether these aspects are truly important to housebuyers. Therefore, we will dig into our project from the view of looking at which factors contribute the most to house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to [8 critical factors that influence a homeâ€™s value](https://www.opendoor.com/w/blog/factors-that-influence-home-value) we see that neighborhood, location, size, age, and upgrades are the relevant factors that determine the value of each house, each of which playing an important role to different degrees. There are also some social and economical factors such as the local real estate market, economic indicators, and interest rates, which are more or less controlled by the government and state-level legislations. Thus, in order to complete a comprehensive analysis on our topic, we will look for datasets that contain descriptive data on the qualities of the asset itself, existing utilities and facilities, proximity to highways, utility lines, and public transit, and the occupancy square footages.\n",

The dataset may be stored and organized as one or serveral tables.

    "* *Implications* \n",
    "\n",
    "The Stakeholders are going to be the people that live in Ames, Iowa. This will help them determine what the factors of a house is important while deciding to buy a house. We don't think that this would create any nefarious side effects, since we are only determining how the overall quality, the functionality, and the style of a house affects house prices. It might slightly influence house owners that want to sell their house, but other than the id and neighborhood, there is not much strong identifiers of the properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Data Collection* \n",
    "\n",
    "We ultimately did not collect any data, since we found some available publicly on kaggle. Considering these are house-prices of that are available for the public to see, they implicitly provide consent to make the such data available to anyone. We believe variables like price and date built were mandatory to be displayed in order for a house to be sold.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Analysis*\n",
    "\n",
    "All of our analysis visualizations do not have any PPI. **`We have no strong analysis conclusions yet.`** We made sure to acknowledge the bias of this dataset toward only looking at the details of the houses and the price of each house. We will be careful in generalizing our results to the typical house.\n",

    "* *Privacy*\n",
    "\n",
    "We are aware that projects need to take into account ethics and privacy, and we need to be careful while handling these issues. In order to assure that we do not infringe such expectations we are going to anonymize our data. By doing so, our results will not harm the owners of the houses we analyze in our database. We will be using the Safe Harbor Method to properly anonymize our data thoroughly and only keep neighborhood as a general location identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Evaluation*\n",
    "\n",
    "Our research is not looking for a result in particular. Thus, we are complying with the Goodhart's Law. We hope to find what factors of the house affects thier prices in the area of study. We will do so by comparing these houses to all the houses in several proximities.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Transparency & Appeal*\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that there is a correlation between house age and house price, but we might end up finding covariates of house sizes or house apparatuses. There are various ways to refute our hypothesis. For instance, if the pattern of distrubution of between house age and house price does not fluctuate with a visible regression, we can easily refute our hypothesis. We could also see a negative correlation. The only way for our hypothesis to succeed is to have a positive correlation for housing age and price."
