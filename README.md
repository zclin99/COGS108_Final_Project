This is your group repo for your final project for COGS108.

This repository is private, and is only visible to the course instructors and your group mates; it is not visible to anyone else.

This repository will be frozen on the final project due date: 11:59pm on Thursday, March 19th. No further changes can be made after that time.

Your project proposal, project check-in, and final project will be graded based solely on the corresponding project notebook in this repository.

Make sure you have a notebook called 'FinalProject_groupXXX.ipynb' (where XXX is replaced by your group number) present in this repository by each due date.
